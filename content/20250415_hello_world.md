My name is Andy, I build Apps and things for a living in the UK. This blog is where I’ll share a few thoughts and topics around tech, links I find interesting, and the occasional side project I create from time to time.


## A few questions to get out of the way

---

### *Why "Tiny Wren"?*

I love wrens. Their lovely round little bodies. Their oddly loud song. The absolute joy of seeing them bob around the garden between flower pots.

Perhaps a [Tweet of the Day](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/b03ths74) puts it best:

> *"[Their song] is the extrovert side of a normally introverted bird."*

I’m a bit of an introverted bird myself — with a slightly round body.

### *What did you build this blog with?*

I'm not a professional web developer, but I like to dabble. Here were my main requirements when choosing a platform:

#### 1. **Self-hosted**

I want to control where I host my stuff. I want to own it — and be able to move it around if I choose to.

#### 2. **Avoid maintenance hell**

In the past, I’ve used WordPress or some kind of Ruby-based platform. Frankly, it was a pain to maintain and a security nightmare.

These days, I don't want the hassle. I'm happy to skip more complex features (like comments or search) if it means less maintenance.

#### 3. **Fast**

I despise slow, confusing, cumbersome websites that take forever to load. I want both the server and the site itself — HTML, JS, CSS — to be lightning fast.

#### 4. **Minimal JavaScript**

I suck at JavaScript, and I want to keep it that way.

This is a blog, not a fancy web app. I don’t want to fight JS just to render something that HTML and CSS were built to handle.

#### 5. **Markdown-based writing**

No WYSIWYG editors, thanks. I deal with enough of those at work in messy internal wikis.

Markdown is simple to use for me.

### *So what’s the setup?*

Here’s what I ended up with:

- **Static site generator:** [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) — simple, fast, and efficient.
- **Theme:** Based on [zola-minimal](https://github.com/semanticdata/zola-minimal/), with some custom edits.
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages — free, fast, and dead easy to update.
- **Domain:** Cloudflare Domains — simple and flexible.

Thats enough for now, I will at some point add some way to contact me.  But in good time I think.
